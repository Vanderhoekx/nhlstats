#NHL Dataset Generator, Uses NHL API calls to populate datasets

#currently generates all teams w/ roster in seperate .json files will make into 1 csv file in the future
#also generates goalie regular/playoff season datasets in a single csv per event

#position is only to seperate player stats from goalie stats, 'G' will generate goalie stats, 
#anything else will generate the players stats

#event is to seperate regular season stats from playoff stats choices are 'playoffs' and 'regular'
